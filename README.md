# Online STL Viewer
This is a current work-in-progress. The goal of this project is to parse STL files and display the 3d model in the browser using WebGL. So far, it works, but only for some models.

## To-do List
- [ ] Parse ASCII STL
- [ ] Add normal calculation (sometimes STL binaries don't have the right normals)
- [ ] Center 3d object around rotation point
- [ ] Mouse view controls
